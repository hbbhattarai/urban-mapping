# Mapping the buildt-up area using the Indices For Landsat 8 OLI

1. Generate_Mask.ipynb

Based on ground truth  it is import to generate mask of urban area. 
Currently i have genrated urban mask for Thimphu using NDVI and NDBI. 
Base image taken to generate mask is Landsat Collotion 2 Level 2 2021 January(Any imagery can be used).

Paper Refered: Improving the normalized difference builtup index to map urban built-up areas using a
semiautomatic segmentation approach

2. supportVectorMachine.ipynb

Based on builtup mask  generated above, I have trained  the model one Landsat imagery Collotion 2 Level 2. Using the model I have mapped the urban areas from Landsat 2021 Level 2 Collection 2 for Dec Thimphu 2021 to validate model.



Notes: There is always the point for importment with resoultion of the satellite data and ground validation
